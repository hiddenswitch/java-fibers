 * An actor implementation extends the {@link co.paralleluniverse.actors.Actor Actor} or {@link co.paralleluniverse.actors.BasicActor BasicActor} class, and is spawned like so:

 * <pre>{@code 
 * ActorRef actor = new MyActor().spawn();
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * You interact with actors through the {@link co.paralleluniverse.actors.ActorRef ActorRef} class.
